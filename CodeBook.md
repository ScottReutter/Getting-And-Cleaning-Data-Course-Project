As discussed in the readme file, this project cleans data from UCI, the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", for later analysis. The variables used in this dataset are as follows:

*The UCI data has been placed into the datasets "x_train", "y_train", "subject_train", "x_test", "y_test", and "subject_test"*  
*These datasets have been merged into the datasets "x_data", "y_data", and "subject_data"*  
*The names for the data are contained in the "features" dataset, which has been applied to the "meanstandard" dataset, an extract containing solely the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; a similar approach has been taken for the "activities" *dataset*  
*The "fulldata" dataset binds the "x_data", "y_data", and "subject_data" datasets into an all-inclusive one*  
*The "averagedata" dataset takes the "fulldata" dataset and extracts the averages for each variable and activity*  

The end product is a cleaned dataset of activity data.
